# Gate Guard Portal KPIs

This document outlines the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Gate Guard Portal, focusing on the most critical metrics that impact security, efficiency, and compliance.

## 1. Entry Processing Efficiency (Parent KPI)
Measures the efficiency of truck entry processing at the gate.

### Child KPIs:
- **Average Processing Time**
  - Formula: Average time between truck arrival and entry decision (verification/rejection)
  - Target: ≤ 5 minutes
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Impact: Directly affects gate congestion and transporter satisfaction

- **First-Time Verification Rate**
  - Formula: (Number of trucks verified without requiring re-verification / Total number of trucks) × 100
  - Target: ≥ 90%
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Impact: Indicates quality of pre-arrival documentation and preparation

## 2. Security Compliance (Parent KPI)
Evaluates the effectiveness of security checks and compliance verification.

### Child KPIs:
- **Documentation Verification Rate**
  - Formula: (Number of trucks with complete document verification / Total number of trucks processed) × 100
  - Components: Driver's License, Vehicle Registration, Insurance, Entry Authorization
  - Target: 100%
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Impact: Critical for regulatory compliance and security

- **Security Incident Rate**
  - Formula: Number of security incidents or violations reported at the gate
  - Target: 0 incidents
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Impact: Measures effectiveness of security protocols

## 3. Gate Utilization (Parent KPI)
Measures the efficiency of gate resource utilization.

### Child KPIs:
- **Peak Hour Performance**
  - Formula: (Number of trucks processed during peak hours / Gate processing capacity during peak hours) × 100
  - Target: ≤ 85% (to maintain buffer capacity)
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Impact: Helps identify need for additional resources during high-traffic periods

- **Queue Time**
  - Formula: Average waiting time in queue before processing begins
  - Target: ≤ 10 minutes
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Impact: Indicates gate efficiency and resource allocation effectiveness

## Implementation Priority
1. Entry Processing Efficiency KPIs
2. Security Compliance KPIs
3. Gate Utilization KPIs

## Data Collection Points
- Gate entry logs
- Document verification records
- Security incident reports
- Queue management system
- QR code scan timestamps
- Gate guard audit trail

## Reporting Frequency
- Daily: Processing times, verification rates, security incidents
- Weekly: Trend analysis and pattern identification
- Monthly: Comprehensive performance review

## Visualization Recommendations
- Real-time dashboard showing current gate status and processing times
- Daily trend charts for processing efficiency
- Security compliance heat maps
- Peak hour utilization graphs

Note: These KPIs should be reviewed quarterly for relevance and target adjustments based on operational needs and security requirements.
