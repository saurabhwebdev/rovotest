# Dock Operations KPIs

This document outlines the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Dock Operations Module, focusing on critical metrics that measure operational efficiency and utilization.

## 1. Dock Utilization Efficiency (Parent KPI)
Primary metric that measures how effectively the docks are being utilized.

### Child KPIs:
- **Dock Occupancy Rate**
  - Formula: (Total time docks are occupied / Total available dock hours) × 100
  - Target: ≥ 85%
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Purpose: Measures the actual utilization of dock resources

- **Average Operation Duration**
  - Formula: Total operation time / Number of operations
  - Target: Loading ≤ 60 minutes, Unloading ≤ 45 minutes
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Purpose: Identifies efficiency of loading/unloading operations

## 2. Operation Performance (Parent KPI)
Measures the effectiveness and quality of dock operations.

### Child KPIs:
- **Operation Completion Rate**
  - Formula: (Number of completed operations / Total operations initiated) × 100
  - Target: ≥ 95%
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Purpose: Tracks successful completion of dock operations

- **Turnaround Time Compliance**
  - Formula: (Number of operations completed within target time / Total operations) × 100
  - Target: ≥ 90%
  - Update Frequency: Daily
  - Purpose: Ensures operations are completed within planned timeframes

## Data Collection Points
- Dock operation start/end timestamps
- Operation type (Loading/Unloading)
- Operation status updates
- Dock assignment records

## Reporting Frequency
- Daily: Operation completion rates, turnaround times
- Weekly: Utilization trends, performance analysis
- Monthly: Comprehensive efficiency review

## Visualization Recommendations
- Real-time dock status dashboard
- Daily operation duration trends
- Dock utilization heat maps
- Performance comparison charts by operation type

Note: KPIs should be reviewed quarterly for target adjustments based on operational patterns and business requirements.
